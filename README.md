# what I learnt

- some functionality is difficult to manage in tkinter. Working within the constraints of the tkinter package, I tried to create something simple and functional.

# what I would improve

-  there is a lot to improve. changing the font colour, changing the position of the watermark, doing batch watermarks, are all things I would like to add.
